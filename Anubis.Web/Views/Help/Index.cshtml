<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
  To get started with LoggingCentral, you must first create a new Application. An
  application represents
    your Azure application. Logs generated will stored within that application and
  will help you manage them.
    On the Applications page, click the "Add new application" button. This will open
  a dialog.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have added your application, it will in your list of Applications.
</p>
<img src="~/Images/Help/ApplicationList.PNG" />
<p>
  Select the application you have just added by clicking on its name. Your application
  will be running within one or several of the Azure 
    data centres. You must now add the various regions that host your application.
  Click the "Monitor New Region" and choose the region. Repeast
    this process for all the regions you want to monitor.
</p>

<p>
  Once you've added a region, you will be able to see the number of log messages generated.
  As this is a new application and you haven't yet
    integrated LoggingCentral into your app, this will read NO DATA.
</p>

<p>
  You're now ready to integrate LoggingCentral into your application so that your
  log messages will be received and displayed within the LoggingCentral 
    platform.
</p>
<h2>Start Logging</h2>
<p>
  No that you have added the application and its regions to Logging Central, you must
  now configure your application to send its logs to Logging Central. At this time
  only <span style="font-weight: bold">NLog</span> is supported.
  To get started, you should first note your applications Logging Code. On the Application's
  page, hit the "App Details" button and not the <span style="font-weight: bold">Application
    Code</span>.
</p>
<img src="~/Images/Help/AppDetailsDialog.PNG" />
<p>
  You can add now add the LoggingCentral to the WebSite, WebRole or WorkerRole you
  want to send logging messages from. Just add the LoggingCentral library from NuGet.
</p>

<p>
  Next, ensure that NLog has been added to your application. You will need to add
  a new target. Open the <span style="font-weight: bold">NLog.config</span>. Your
  target is added like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;nlog xmlns="http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" autoReload="true"&gt;

  &lt;!-- This brings in the LoggingCentral library --&gt;
  &lt;extensions&gt;
    &lt;add assembly="LoggingCentral"/&gt;
  &lt;/extensions&gt;

  &lt;!-- This target sends your log messages to LoggingCentral.  --&gt; 
  &lt;!-- Use the Application Code you noted earlier. --&gt;
  &lt;targets async="true"&gt;
    &lt;target xsi:type="AnubisTarget" name="lc" code="1Y4DH7788WS" layout="${message}" /&gt;
  &lt;/targets&gt;

  &lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;logger name="*" minlevel="Debug" writeTo="lc" /&gt;
  &lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/nlog&gt;
    </pre>
</div>
<p>
  With that, all that's left is to invoke NLog using your application. Once you've
  generated a few logging statements
  you can refresh your Application's dashboard and you should see messages reported!

<p>
  Happy Logging and may your logs never be errors!
